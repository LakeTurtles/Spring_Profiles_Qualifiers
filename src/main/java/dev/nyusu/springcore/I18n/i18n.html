        <h1>Internationalization (i18n)</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p>"I18n" stands for internationalization, and it is a common abbreviation used in the field of software development and localization. Internationalization is the process of designing and preparing a software application to be adapted for different languages and regions without engineering changes.</p>

        <p>The number "18" in "I18n" represents the 18 letters between "I" and "n" in the word "internationalization." This shorthand is used to make the term more concise and easier to write.</p>

        <p>Internationalization involves making a software application capable of displaying content, messages, and other elements in multiple languages, as well as adapting to different cultural conventions, date formats, currency symbols, and other regional specifics. The goal is to create a flexible and user-friendly application that can be easily customized for different linguistic and cultural contexts.</p>

        <p>By separating the code from the text and other locale-specific elements, developers can create a foundation for localization, which is the process of adapting the software for a specific language or region. Together, internationalization and localization (often referred to as "i18n and l10n") contribute to the global accessibility and usability of software applications.</p>
